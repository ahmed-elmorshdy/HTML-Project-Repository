      A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, system board,
      baseboard, planar board, logic board, or mobo) is the main printed circuit
      board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It
      holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic
      components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and
      memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane,
      a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the
      central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers,
      interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.
      Motherboard means specifically a PCB with expansion capabilities. As the
      name suggests, this board is often referred to as the "mother" of all
      components attached to it, which often include peripherals, interface
      cards, and daughtercards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, host
      bus adapters, TV tuner cards, IEEE 1394 cards; and a variety of other
      custom components. Dell Precision T3600 System Motherboard, used in
      professional CAD Workstations. Manufactured in 2012 Similarly, the term
      mainboard describes a device with a single board and no additional
      expansions or capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers,
      television sets, washing machines, mobile phones, and other embedded
      systems with limited expansion abilities.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Prior to the invention of the microprocessor, the digital computer
      consisted of multiple printed circuit boards in a card-cage case with
      components connected by a backplane, a set of interconnected sockets. In
      very old designs, copper wires were the discrete connections between card
      connector pins, but printed circuit boards soon became the standard
      practice. The central processing unit (CPU), memory, and peripherals were
      housed on individually printed circuit boards, which were plugged into the
      backplane. The ubiquitous S-100 bus of the 1970s is an example of this
      type of backplane system. The most popular computers of the 1980s such as
      the Apple II and IBM PC had published schematic diagrams and other
      documentation which permitted rapid reverse-engineering and third-party
      replacement motherboards. Usually intended for building new computers
      compatible with the exemplars, many motherboards offered additional
      performance or other features and were used to upgrade the manufacturer's
      original equipment. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it became
      economical to move an increasing number of peripheral functions onto the
      motherboard. In the late 1980s, personal computer motherboards began to
      include single ICs (also called Super I/O chips) capable of supporting a
      set of low-speed peripherals: PS/2 keyboard and mouse, floppy disk drive,
      serial ports, and parallel ports. By the late 1970s, many personal
      computer motherboards included consumer-grade embedded audio, video,
      storage, and networking functions without the need for any expansion cards
      at all; higher-end systems for 3D gaming and computer graphics typically
      retained only the graphics card as a separate component. Business PCs,
      workstations, and servers were more likely to need expansion cards, either
      for more robust functions, or for higher speeds; those systems often had
      fewer embedded components. Laptop and notebook computers that were
      developed in the 1990s integrated the most common peripherals. This even
      included motherboards with no upgradeable components, a trend that would
      continue as smaller systems were introduced after the turn of the century
      (like the tablet computer and the netbook). Memory, processors, network
      controllers, power source, and storage would be integrated into some
      systems.

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>
      A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other
      components of the system communicate. Unlike a backplane, it also contains
      the central processing unit and hosts other subsystems and devices. A
      typical desktop computer has its microprocessor, main memory, and other
      essential components connected to the motherboard. Other components such
      as external storage, controllers for video display and sound, and
      peripheral devices may be attached to the motherboard as plug-in cards or
      via cables; in modern microcomputers, it is increasingly common to
      integrate some of these peripherals into the motherboard itself. An
      important component of a motherboard is the microprocessor's supporting
      chipset, which provides the supporting interfaces between the CPU and the
      various buses and external components. This chipset determines, to an
      extent, the features and capabilities of the motherboard.
    </p>
    <h2>Form factor</h2>
    <p>
      Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shape called computer
      form factor, some of which are specific to individual computer
      manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible systems
      are designed to fit various case sizes. As of 2005, most desktop computer
      motherboards use the ATX standard form factor â€” even those found in
      Macintosh and Sun computers, which have not been built from commodity
      components. A case's motherboard and power supply unit (PSU) form factor
      must all match, though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same
      family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually
      accommodate a microATX motherboard. Laptop computers generally use highly
      integrated, miniaturized, and customized motherboards. This is one of the
      reasons that laptop computers are difficult to upgrade and expensive to
      repair. Often the failure of one laptop component requires the replacement
      of the entire motherboard, which is usually more expensive than a desktop
      motherboard
    </p>
    <h2>CPU sockets</h2>
    <p>
      A CPU socket (central processing unit) or slot is an electrical component
      that attaches to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and is designed to house a
      CPU (also called a microprocessor). It is a special type of integrated
      circuit socket designed for very high pin counts. A CPU socket provides
      many functions, including a physical structure to support the CPU, support
      for a heat sink, facilitating replacement (as well as reducing cost), and
      most importantly, forming an electrical interface both with the CPU and
      the PCB. CPU sockets on the motherboard can most often be found in most
      desktop and server computers (laptops typically use surface mount CPUs),
      particularly those based on the Intel x86 architecture. A CPU socket type
      and motherboard chipset must support the CPU series and speed.
    </p>
    <h2>Peripheral card slots</h2>
    <p>
      A typical motherboard will have a different number of connections
      depending on its standard and form factor. A standard, modern ATX
      motherboard will typically have two or three PCI-Express x16 connection
      for a graphics card, one or two legacy PCI slots for various expansion
      cards, and one or two PCI-E x1 (which has superseded PCI). A standard EATX
      motherboard will have two to four PCI-E x16 connection for graphics cards,
      and a varying number of PCI and PCI-E x1 slots. It can sometimes also have
      a PCI-E x4 slot (will vary between brands and models). Some motherboards
      have two or more PCI-E x16 slots, to allow more than 2 monitors without
      special hardware, or use a special graphics technology called SLI (for
      Nvidia) and Crossfire (for AMD). These allow 2 to 4 graphics cards to be
      linked together, to allow better performance in intensive graphical
      computing tasks, such as gaming, video editing, etc.
