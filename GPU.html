    <h2>What is Graphics processing unit</h2>
    <p>
      A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit
      designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation
      of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs
      are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers,
      workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are very efficient at
      manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their highly parallel
      structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central
      processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data
      in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card
      or embedded on the motherboard. In certain CPUs, they are embedded on the
      CPU die. In the 1970s, the term "GPU" originally stood for graphics
      processor unit and described a programmable processing unit independently
      working from the CPU and responsible for graphics manipulation and output.
      Later, in 1994, Sony used the term (now standing for graphics processing
      unit) in reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU
      in 1994. The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the
      GeForce 256 as "the world's first GPU". It was presented as a "single-chip
      processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping,
      and rendering engines". Rival ATI Technologies coined the term "visual
      processing unit" or VPU with the release of the Radeon 9700 in 2002.

    <h2>GPU companies</h2>
    <p>
      Many companies have produced GPUs under a number of brand names. In 2009,
      Intel, Nvidia and AMD/ATI were the market share leaders, with 49.4%, 27.8%
      and 20.6% market share respectively. However, those numbers include
      Intel's integrated graphics solutions as GPUs. Not counting those, Nvidia
      and AMD control nearly 100% of the market as of 2018. Their respective
      market shares are 66% and 33%. In addition, S3 Graphics and Matrox produce
      GPUs. Modern smartphones also use mostly Adreno GPUs from Qualcomm,
      PowerVR GPUs from Imagination Technologies and Mali GPUs from ARM.
    </p>
    <h2>GPU accelerated video decoding and encoding</h2>
    <p>
      Most GPUs made since 1995 support the YUV color space and hardware
      overlays, important for digital video playback, and many GPUs made since
      2000 also support MPEG primitives such as motion compensation and iDCT.
      This process of hardware accelerated video decoding, where portions of the
      video decoding process and video post-processing are offloaded to the GPU
      hardware, is commonly referred to as "GPU accelerated video decoding",
      "GPU assisted video decoding", "GPU hardware accelerated video decoding"
      or "GPU hardware assisted video decoding". More recent graphics cards even
      decode high-definition video on the card, offloading the central
      processing unit. The most common APIs for GPU accelerated video decoding
      are DxVA for Microsoft Windows operating system and VDPAU, VAAPI, XvMC,
      and XvBA for Linux-based and UNIX-like operating systems. All except XvMC
      are capable of decoding videos encoded with MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP
      (MPEG-4 Part 2), MPEG-4 AVC (H.264 / DivX 6), VC-1, WMV3/WMV9, Xvid /
      OpenDivX (DivX 4), and DivX 5 codecs, while XvMC is only capable of
      decoding MPEG-1 and MPEG-2.
    </p>
    <h2>Dedicated graphics cards</h2>
    <p>
      The GPUs of the most powerful class typically interface with the
      motherboard by means of an expansion slot such as PCI Express (PCIe) or
      Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) and can usually be replaced or upgraded
      with relative ease, assuming the motherboard is capable of supporting the
      upgrade. A few graphics cards still use Peripheral Component Interconnect
      (PCI) slots, but their bandwidth is so limited that they are generally
      used only when a PCIe or AGP slot is not available. A dedicated GPU is not
      necessarily removable, nor does it necessarily interface with the
      motherboard in a standard fashion. The term "dedicated" refers to the fact
      that dedicated graphics cards have RAM that is dedicated to the card's
      use, not to the fact that most dedicated GPUs are removable. Further, this
      RAM is usually specially selected for the expected serial workload of the
      graphics card (see GDDR). Sometimes, systems with dedicated, discrete GPUs
      were called "DIS" systems, as opposed to "UMA" systems (see next section).
      Dedicated GPUs for portable computers are most commonly interfaced through
      a non-standard and often proprietary slot due to size and weight
      constraints. Such ports may still be considered PCIe or AGP in terms of
      their logical host interface, even if they are not physically
      interchangeable with their counterparts. Technologies such as SLI and
      NVLink by Nvidia and CrossFire by AMD allow multiple GPUs to draw images
      simultaneously for a single screen, increasing the processing power
      available for graphics. These technologies, however, are increasingly
      uncommon, as most games do not fully utilize multiple GPUs, as most users
      cannot afford them. Multiple GPUs are still used on supercomputers (like
      in Summit), on workstations to accelerate video (processing multiple
      videos at once) and 3D rendering, for VFX and for simulations, and in AI
      to expedite training, as is the case with Nvidia's lineup of DGX
      workstations and servers and Tesla GPUs and Intel's upcoming Ponte Vecchio
      GPUs.

    <h2>Integrated graphics processing unit</h2>

    <p>
      Integrated graphics processing unit (IGPU), Integrated graphics, shared
      graphics solutions, integrated graphics processors (IGP) or unified memory
      architecture (UMA) utilize a portion of a computer's system RAM rather
      than dedicated graphics memory. IGPs can be integrated onto the
      motherboard as part of the (northbridge) chipset, or on the same die
      (integrated circuit) with the CPU (like AMD APU or Intel HD Graphics). On
      certain motherboards, AMD's IGPs can use dedicated sideport[clarification
      needed] memory. This is a separate fixed block of high performance memory
      that is dedicated for use by the GPU. In early 2007, computers with
      integrated graphics account for about 90% of all PC shipments. They are
      less costly to implement than dedicated graphics processing, but tend to
      be less capable. Historically, integrated processing was considered unfit
      to play 3D games or run graphically intensive programs but could run less
      intensive programs such as Adobe Flash. Examples of such IGPs would be
      offerings from SiS and VIA circa 2004. However, modern integrated graphics
      processors such as AMD Accelerated Processing Unit and Intel HD Graphics
      are more than capable of handling 2D graphics or low stress 3D graphics.
      Since the GPU computations are extremely memory-intensive, integrated
      processing may find itself competing with the CPU for the relatively slow
      system RAM, as it has minimal or no dedicated video memory. IGPs can have
      up to 29.856 GB/s of memory bandwidth from system RAM, whereas a graphics
      card may have up to 264 GB/s of bandwidth between its RAM and GPU core.
      This memory bus bandwidth can limit the performance of the GPU, though
      multi-channel memory can mitigate this deficiency. Older integrated
      graphics chipsets lacked hardware transform and lighting, but newer ones
      include it.
    </p>
    <h2>External GPU (eGPU)</h2>
    <p>
      An external GPU is a graphics processor located outside of the housing of
      the computer, similar to a large external hard drive. External graphics
      processors are sometimes used with laptop computers. Laptops might have a
      substantial amount of RAM and a sufficiently powerful central processing
      unit (CPU), but often lack a powerful graphics processor, and instead have
      a less powerful but more energy-efficient on-board graphics chip. On-board
      graphics chips are often not powerful enough for playing video games, or
      for other graphically intensive tasks, such as editing video or 3D
      animation/rendering. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to attach a GPU
      to some external bus of a notebook. PCI Express is the only bus used for
      this purpose. The port may be, for example, an ExpressCard or mPCIe port
      (PCIe ×1, up to 5 or 2.5 Gbit/s respectively) or a Thunderbolt 1, 2, or 3
      port (PCIe ×4, up to 10, 20, or 40 Gbit/s respectively). Those ports are
      only available on certain notebook systems. eGPU enclosures include their
      own power supply (PSU), because powerful GPUs can easily consume hundreds
      of watts. Official vendor support for external GPUs has gained traction
      recently. One notable milestone was Apple's decision to officially support
      external GPUs with MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4. There are also several major
      hardware vendors (HP, Alienware, Razer) releasing Thunderbolt 3 eGPU
      enclosures. This support has continued to fuel eGPU implementations by
      enthusiasts.
