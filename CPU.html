    <h1>CPU</h1>
    <h2>What is Central processing unit</h2>
    <p>
      A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main
      processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes
      instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic
      arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations
      specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external
      components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized
      processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs). The form, design, and
      implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental
      operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include
      the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic
      operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store
      the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the
      fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the
      coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components. Most
      modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors,
      with one or more CPUs on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) IC chip.
      Microprocessors chips with multiple CPUs are multi-core processors. The
      individual physical CPUs, processor cores, can also be multithreaded to
      create additional virtual or logical CPUs. An IC that contains a CPU may
      also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a
      computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or
      systems on a chip (SoC). Array processors or vector processors have
      multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no unit considered
      central. Virtual CPUs are an abstraction of dynamical aggregated
      computational resources.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Early computers such as the ENIAC had to be physically rewired to perform
      different tasks, which caused these machines to be called "fixed-program
      computers". The "central processing unit" term has been in use since as
      early as 1955. Since the term "CPU" is generally defined as a device for
      software (computer program) execution, the earliest devices that could
      rightly be called CPUs came with the advent of the stored-program
      computer. The idea of a stored-program computer had been already present
      in the design of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly's ENIAC, but
      was initially omitted so that it could be finished sooner. On June 30,
      1945, before ENIAC was made, mathematician John von Neumann distributed
      the paper entitled First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. It was the
      outline of a stored-program computer that would eventually be completed in
      August 1949. EDVAC was designed to perform a certain number of
      instructions (or operations) of various types. Significantly, the programs
      written for EDVAC were to be stored in high-speed computer memory rather
      than specified by the physical wiring of the computer. This overcame a
      severe limitation of ENIAC, which was the considerable time and effort
      required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task. With von
      Neumann's design, the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by
      changing the contents of the memory. EDVAC, however, was not the first
      stored-program computer; the Manchester Baby, a small-scale experimental
      stored-program computer, ran its first program on 21 June 1948 and the
      Manchester Mark 1 ran its first program during the night of 16â€“17 June
      1949. Early CPUs were custom designs used as part of a larger and
      sometimes distinctive computer. However, this method of designing custom
      CPUs for a particular application has largely given way to the development
      of multi-purpose processors produced in large quantities. This
      standardization began in the era of discrete transistor mainframes and
      minicomputers and has rapidly accelerated with the popularization of the
      integrated circuit (IC). The IC has allowed increasingly complex CPUs to
      be designed and manufactured to tolerances on the order of nanometers.
      Both the miniaturization and standardization of CPUs have increased the
      presence of digital devices in modern life far beyond the limited
      application of dedicated computing machines. Modern microprocessors appear
      in electronic devices ranging from automobiles to cellphones, and
      sometimes even in toys. While von Neumann is most often credited with the
      design of the stored-program computer because of his design of EDVAC, and
      the design became known as the von Neumann architecture, others before
      him, such as Konrad Zuse, had suggested and implemented similar ideas. The
      so-called Harvard architecture of the Harvard Mark I, which was completed
      before EDVAC, also used a stored-program design using punched paper tape
      rather than electronic memory. The key difference between the von Neumann
      and Harvard architectures is that the latter separates the storage and
      treatment of CPU instructions and data, while the former uses the same
      memory space for both. Most modern CPUs are primarily von Neumann in
      design, but CPUs with the Harvard architecture are seen as well,
      especially in embedded applications; for instance, the Atmel AVR
      microcontrollers are Harvard architecture processors. Relays and vacuum
      tubes (thermionic tubes) were commonly used as switching elements; a
      useful computer requires thousands or tens of thousands of switching
      devices. The overall speed of a system is dependent on the speed of the
      switches. Vacuum tube computers such as EDVAC tended to average eight
      hours between failures, whereas relay computers like the (slower, but
      earlier) Harvard Mark I failed very rarely. In the end, tube-based CPUs
      became dominant because the significant speed advantages afforded
      generally outweighed the reliability problems. Most of these early
      synchronous CPUs ran at low clock rates compared to modern microelectronic
      designs. Clock signal frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 4 MHz were very
      common at this time, limited largely by the speed of the switching devices
      they were built with.
    </p>
    <h2>Transistor CPUs</h2>
    <p>
      The design complexity of CPUs increased as various technologies
      facilitated building smaller and more reliable electronic devices. The
      first such improvement came with the advent of the transistor.
      Transistorized CPUs during the 1950s and 1960s no longer had to be built
      out of bulky, unreliable and fragile switching elements like vacuum tubes
      and relays. With this improvement, more complex and reliable CPUs were
      built onto one or several printed circuit boards containing discrete
      (individual) components. In 1964, IBM introduced its IBM System/360
      computer architecture that was used in a series of computers capable of
      running the same programs with different speed and performance. This was
      significant at a time when most electronic computers were incompatible
      with one another, even those made by the same manufacturer. To facilitate
      this improvement, IBM used the concept of a microprogram (often called
      "microcode"), which still sees widespread usage in modern CPUs. The
      System/360 architecture was so popular that it dominated the mainframe
      computer market for decades and left a legacy that is still continued by
      similar modern computers like the IBM zSeries. In 1965, Digital Equipment
      Corporation (DEC) introduced another influential computer aimed at the
      scientific and research markets, the PDP-8. Fujitsu board with SPARC64
      VIIIfx processors Transistor-based computers had several distinct
      advantages over their predecessors. Aside from facilitating increased
      reliability and lower power consumption, transistors also allowed CPUs to
      operate at much higher speeds because of the short switching time of a
      transistor in comparison to a tube or relay. The increased reliability and
      dramatically increased speed of the switching elements (which were almost
      exclusively transistors by this time); CPU clock rates in the tens of
      megahertz were easily obtained during this period. Additionally, while
      discrete transistor and IC CPUs were in heavy usage, new high-performance
      designs like SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vector processors
      began to appear. These early experimental designs later gave rise to the
      era of specialized supercomputers like those made by Cray Inc and Fujitsu
      Ltd.

    <h2>Small-scale integration CPUs</h2>
    <p>
      During this period, a method of manufacturing many interconnected
      transistors in a compact space was developed. The integrated circuit (IC)
      allowed a large number of transistors to be manufactured on a single
      semiconductor-based die, or "chip". At first, only very basic
      non-specialized digital circuits such as NOR gates were miniaturized into
      ICs. CPUs based on these "building block" ICs are generally referred to as
      "small-scale integration" (SSI) devices. SSI ICs, such as the ones used in
      the Apollo Guidance Computer, usually contained up to a few dozen
      transistors. To build an entire CPU out of SSI ICs required thousands of
      individual chips, but still consumed much less space and power than
      earlier discrete transistor designs. IBM's System/370, follow-on to the
      System/360, used SSI ICs rather than Solid Logic Technology
      discrete-transistor modules. DEC's PDP-8/I and KI10 PDP-10 also switched
      from the individual transistors used by the PDP-8 and PDP-10 to SSI ICs,
      and their extremely popular PDP-11 line was originally built with SSI ICs
      but was eventually implemented with LSI components once these became
      practical.

    <h2>Microprocessors</h2>
    <p>
      Advances in MOS IC technology led to the invention of the microprocessor
      in the early 1970s. Since the introduction of the first commercially
      available microprocessor, the Intel 4004 in 1971, and the first widely
      used microprocessor, the Intel 8080 in 1974, this class of CPUs has almost
      completely overtaken all other central processing unit implementation
      methods. Mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers of the time launched
      proprietary IC development programs to upgrade their older computer
      architectures, and eventually produced instruction set compatible
      microprocessors that were backward-compatible with their older hardware
      and software. Combined with the advent and eventual success of the
      ubiquitous personal computer, the term CPU is now applied almost
      exclusively[a] to microprocessors. Several CPUs (denoted cores) can be
      combined in a single processing chip. Previous generations of CPUs were
      implemented as discrete components and numerous small integrated circuits
      (ICs) on one or more circuit boards. Microprocessors, on the other hand,
      are CPUs manufactured on a very small number of ICs; usually just one. The
      overall smaller CPU size, as a result of being implemented on a single
      die, means faster switching time because of physical factors like
      decreased gate parasitic capacitance. This has allowed synchronous
      microprocessors to have clock rates ranging from tens of megahertz to
      several gigahertz. Additionally, the ability to construct exceedingly
      small transistors on an IC has increased the complexity and number of
      transistors in a single CPU many fold. This widely observed trend is
      described by Moore's law, which had proven to be a fairly accurate
      predictor of the growth of CPU (and other IC) complexity until 2016. While
      the complexity, size, construction and general form of CPUs have changed
      enormously since 1950, the basic design and function has not changed much
      at all. Almost all common CPUs today can be very accurately described as
      von Neumann stored-program machines.[b] As Moore's law no longer holds,
      concerns have arisen about the limits of integrated circuit transistor
      technology. Extreme miniaturization of electronic gates is causing the
      effects of phenomena like electromigration and subthreshold leakage to
      become much more significant. These newer concerns are among the many
      factors causing researchers to investigate new methods of computing such
      as the quantum computer, as well as to expand the usage of parallelism and
      other methods that extend the usefulness of the classical von Neumann
      model.

    <h2>Structure and implementation</h2>
    <img src="Images/cpu structure.gif" alt="CPU Structure" id="image" />
    <p>
      Hardwired into a CPU's circuitry is a set of basic operations it can
      perform, called an instruction set. Such operations may involve, for
      example, adding or subtracting two numbers, comparing two numbers, or
      jumping to a different part of a program. Each basic operation is
      represented by a particular combination of bits, known as the machine
      language opcode; while executing instructions in a machine language
      program, the CPU decides which operation to perform by "decoding" the
      opcode. A complete machine language instruction consists of an opcode and,
      in many cases, additional bits that specify arguments for the operation
      (for example, the numbers to be summed in the case of an addition
      operation). Going up the complexity scale, a machine language program is a
      collection of machine language instructions that the CPU executes. The
      actual mathematical operation for each instruction is performed by a
      combinational logic circuit within the CPU's processor known as the
      arithmetic logic unit or ALU. In general, a CPU executes an instruction by
      fetching it from memory, using its ALU to perform an operation, and then
      storing the result to memory. Beside the instructions for integer
      mathematics and logic operations, various other machine instructions
      exist, such as those for loading data from memory and storing it back,
      branching operations, and mathematical operations on floating-point
      numbers performed by the CPU's floating-point unit (FPU).
