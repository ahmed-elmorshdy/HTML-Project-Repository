      Each machine has its own, unique personality which probably could be
      defined as the intuitive sum total of everything you know and feel about
      it. This personality constantly changes, usually for the worse, but
      sometimes surprisingly for the better...

      This book is about designing and building specialized computers. We all
      know what a computer is. It’s that box that sits on your desk, quietly
      purring away (or rattling if the fan is shot), running your programs and
      regularly crashing (if you’re not running some variety of Unix). Inside
      that box is the electronics that runs your software, stores your
      information, and connects you to the world. It’s all about processing
      information. Designing a computer, therefore, is about designing a machine
      that holds and manipulates data. Computer systems fall into essentially
      two separate categories. The first, and most obvious, is that of the
      desktop computer. When you say “computer” to someone, this is the machine
      that usually comes to her mind. The second type of computer is the
      embedded computer, a computer that is integrated into another system for
      the purposes of control and/or monitoring. Embedded computers are far more
      numerous than desktop systems, but far less obvious. Ask the average
      person how many computers he has in his home, and he might reply that he
      has one or two. In fact, he may have 30 or more, hidden inside his TVs,
      VCRs, DVD players, remote controls, washing machines, cell phones, air
      conditioners, game consoles, ovens, toys, and a host of other devices. In
      this chapter, we’ll look at computer architecture in general. This is
      applicable to both embedded and desktop computers, because the primary
      difference between an embedded machine and a general-purpose computer is
      its application. The basic principles of operation and the underlying
      architectures are fundamentally the same. Both have a processor, memory,
      and often several forms of input and output. The primary difference lies
      in their intended use, and this is reflected in the system design and
      their software. Desktop computers can run a variety of application
      programs, with system resources orchestrated by an operating system. By
      running different application programs, the functionality of the desktop
      computer is changed. One moment, it may be used as a word processor; the
      next it is an MP3 player or a database client. Which software is loaded
      and run is under user control. In contrast, the embedded computer is
      normally dedicated to a specific task. In many cases, an embedded system
      is used to replace application-specific electronics. The advantage of
      using an embedded microprocessor over dedicated electronics is that the
      functionality of the system is determined by the software, not the
      hardware. This makes the embedded system easier to produce, and much
      easier to evolve, than a complicated circuit. The embedded system
      typically has one application and one application only, which is
      permanently running. The embedded computer may or may not have an
      operating system, and rarely does it provide the user with the ability to
      arbitrarily install new software. The software is normally contained in
      the system’s nonvolatile memory, unlike a desktop computer where the
      nonvolatile memory contains boot software and (maybe) low-level drivers
      only. Embedded hardware is often much simpler than a desktop system, but
      it can also be far more complex too. An embedded computer may be
      implemented in a single chip with just a few support components, and its
      purpose may be as crude as a controller for a garden-watering system.
      Alternatively, the embedded computer may be a 150-processor, distributed
      parallel machine responsible for all the flight and control systems of a
      commercial jet. As diverse as embedded hardware may be, the underlying
      principles of design are the same.

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>
      Let’s start at the beginning. In essence, a computer is a machine designed
      to process, store, and retrieve data. Data may be numbers in a
      spreadsheet, characters of text in a document, dots of color in an image,
      waveforms of sound, or the state of some system, such as an air
      conditioner or a CD player. All data is stored in the computer as numbers.
      It’s easy to forget this when we’re deep in C code, contemplating complex
      algorithms and data structures. The computer manipulates the data by
      performing operations on the numbers. Displaying an image on a screen is
      accomplished by moving an array of numbers to the video memory, each
      number representing a pixel of color. To play an MP3 audio file, the
      computer reads an array of numbers from disk and into memory, manipulates
      those numbers to convert the compressed audio data into raw audio data,
      and then outputs the new set of numbers (the raw audio data) to the audio
      chip. Everything that a computer does, from web browsing to printing,
      involves moving and processing numbers. The electronics of a computer is
      nothing more than a system designed to hold, move, and change numbers. A
      computer system is composed of many parts, both hardware and software. At
      the heart of the computer is the processor, the hardware that executes the
      computer programs. The computer also has memory, often several different
      types in one system. The memory is used to store programs while the
      processor is running them, as well as store the data that the programs are
      manipulating. The computer also has devices for storing data, or
      exchanging data with the outside world. These may allow the input of text
      via a keyboard, the display of information on a screen, or the movement of
      programs and data to or from a disk drive. The software controls the
      operation and functionality of the computer. There are many “layers” of
      software in the computer. Typically, a given layer will only interact with
      the layers immediately above or below it.

      At the lowest level, there are programs that are run by the processor when
      the computer first powers up. These programs initialize the other hardware
      subsystems to a known state and configure the computer for correct
      operation. This software, because it is permanently stored in the
      computer’s memory, is known as firmware . The bootloader is located in the
      firmware. The bootloader is a special program run by the processor that
      reads the operating system from disk (or nonvolatile memory or network
      interface) and places it in memory so that the processor may then run it.
      The bootloader is present in desktop computers and workstations, and may
      be present in some embedded computers. Above the firmware, the operating
      system controls the operation of the computer. It organizes the use of
      memory and controls devices such as the keyboard, mouse, screen, disk
      drives, and so on. It is also the software that often provides an
      interface to the user, enabling her to run application programs and access
      her files on disk. The operating system typically provides a set of
      software tools for application programs, providing a mechanism by which
      they too can access the screen, disk drives, and so on. Not all embedded
      systems use or even need an operating system. Often, an embedded system
      will simply run code dedicated to its task, and the presence of an
      operating system is overkill. In other instances, such as network routers,
      an operating system provides necessary software integration and greatly
      simplifies the development process. Whether an operating system is needed
      and useful really depends on the intended purpose of the embedded computer
      and, to a lesser degree, on the preference of the designer. At the highest
      level, the application software constitutes the programs that provide the
      functionality of the computer. Everything below the application is
      considered system software . For embedded computers, the boundary between
      application and system software is often blurred. This reflects the
      underlying principle in embedded design that a system should be designed
      to achieve its objective in as simple and straightforward a manner as
      possible.
