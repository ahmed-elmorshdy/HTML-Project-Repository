    <h2>What is Random-access memory</h2>
    <p>
      Random-access memory (RAM; /ræm/) is a form of computer memory that can be
      read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and
      machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read
      or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical
      location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access
      data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older
      magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data
      items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the
      recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation
      speeds and arm movement. RAM contains multiplexing and demultiplexing
      circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading
      or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by
      the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are
      said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc. devices.[clarification needed] In
      today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated
      circuit (IC) chips with MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) memory cells. RAM
      is normally associated with volatile types of memory (such as dynamic
      random-access memory (DRAM) modules), where stored information is lost if
      power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed. Other
      types of non-volatile memories exist that allow random access for read
      operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds
      of limitations on them. These include most types of ROM and a type of
      flash memory called NOR-Flash. The two main types of volatile
      random-access semiconductor memory are static random-access memory (SRAM)
      and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Commercial uses of semiconductor
      RAM date back to 1965, when IBM introduced the SP95 SRAM chip for their
      System/360 Model 95 computer, and Toshiba used DRAM memory cells for its
      Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, both based on bipolar transistors.
      Commercial MOS memory, based on MOS transistors, was developed in the late
      1960s, and has since been the basis for all commercial semiconductor
      memory. The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the Intel 1103, was introduced
      in October 1970. Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) later
      debuted with the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in 1992.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Early computers used relays, mechanical counters or delay lines for main
      memory functions. Ultrasonic delay lines were serial devices which could
      only reproduce data in the order it was written. Drum memory could be
      expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items
      required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed.
      Latches built out of vacuum tube triodes, and later, out of discrete
      transistors, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers.
      Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large
      amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such
      memory could be provided. The first practical form of random-access memory
      was the Williams tube starting in 1947. It stored data as electrically
      charged spots on the face of a cathode ray tube. Since the electron beam
      of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory
      was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to
      around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more
      power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. Developed at
      the University of Manchester in England, the Williams tube provided the
      medium on which the first electronically stored program was implemented in
      the Manchester Baby computer, which first successfully ran a program on 21
      June 1948. In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed
      for the Baby, the Baby was a testbed to demonstrate the reliability of the
      memory. Magnetic-core memory was invented in 1947 and developed up until
      the mid-1970s. It became a widespread form of random-access memory,
      relying on an array of magnetized rings. By changing the sense of each
      ring's magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring.
      Since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or
      write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible.
      Magnetic core memory was the standard form of computer memory system until
      displaced by solid-state MOS (metal-oxide-silicon) semiconductor memory in
      integrated circuits (ICs) during the early 1970s. Prior to the development
      of integrated read-only memory (ROM) circuits, permanent (or read-only)
      random-access memory was often constructed using diode matrices driven by
      address decoders, or specially wound core rope memory planes.[citation
      needed] Semiconductor memory began in the 1960s with bipolar memory, which
      used bipolar transistors. While it improved performance, it could not
      compete with the lower price of magnetic core memory.

    <h2>DMOS RAM</h2>
    <p>
      The invention of the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
      transistor), also known as the MOS transistor, by Mohamed M. Atalla and
      Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, led to the development of
      metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) memory by John Schmidt at Fairchild
      Semiconductor in 1964. In addition to higher performance, MOS
      semiconductor memory was cheaper and consumed less power than magnetic
      core memory. The development of silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit (MOS
      IC) technology by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in 1968 enabled the
      production of MOS memory chips. MOS memory overtook magnetic core memory
      as the dominant memory technology in the early 1970s. An integrated
      bipolar static random-access memory (SRAM) was invented by Robert H.
      Norman at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963. It was followed by the
      development of MOS SRAM by John Schmidt at Fairchild in 1964. SRAM became
      an alternative to magnetic-core memory, but required six MOS transistors
      for each bit of data. Commercial use of SRAM began in 1965, when IBM
      introduced the SP95 memory chip for the System/360 Model 95. Dynamic
      random-access memory (DRAM) allowed replacement of a 4 or 6-transistor
      latch circuit by a single transistor for each memory bit, greatly
      increasing memory density at the cost of volatility. Data was stored in
      the tiny capacitance of each transistor, and had to be periodically
      refreshed every few milliseconds before the charge could leak away.
      Toshiba's Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, which was introduced in
      1965, used a form of capacitive bipolar DRAM, storing 180-bit data on
      discrete memory cells, consisting of germanium bipolar transistors and
      capacitors. While it offered improved performance over magnetic-core
      memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then
      dominant magnetic-core memory. MOS technology is the basis for modern
      DRAM. In 1966, Dr. Robert H. Dennard at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research
      Center was working on MOS memory. While examining the characteristics of
      MOS technology, he found it was capable of building capacitors, and that
      storing a charge or no charge on the MOS capacitor could represent the 1
      and 0 of a bit, while the MOS transistor could control writing the charge
      to the capacitor. This led to his development of a single-transistor DRAM
      memory cell. In 1967, Dennard filed a patent under IBM for a
      single-transistor DRAM memory cell, based on MOS technology. The first
      commercial DRAM IC chip was the Intel 1103, which was manufactured on an 8
      µm MOS process with a capacity of 1 kbit, and was released in 1970.
      Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) was developed by Samsung
      Electronics. The first commercial SDRAM chip was the Samsung KM48SL2000,
      which had a capacity of 16 Mbit. It was introduced by Samsung in 1992, and
      mass-produced in 1993. The first commercial DDR SDRAM (double data rate
      SDRAM) memory chip was Samsung's 64 Mbit DDR SDRAM chip, released in June
      1998. GDDR (graphics DDR) is a form of DDR SGRAM (synchronous graphics
      RAM), which was first released by Samsung as a 16 Mbit memory chip in
      1998.

    <h2>Types</h2>
    <p>
      The two widely used forms of modern RAM are static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic
      RAM (DRAM). In SRAM, a bit of data is stored using the state of a
      six-transistor memory cell, typically using six MOSFETs
      (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors). This form of RAM is
      more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less
      dynamic power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used as cache
      memory for the CPU. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and
      capacitor pair (typically a MOSFET and MOS capacitor, respectively), which
      together comprise a DRAM cell. The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1
      or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the
      control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or
      change it. As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static
      RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern
      computers. Both static and dynamic RAM are considered volatile, as their
      state is lost or reset when power is removed from the system. By contrast,
      read-only memory (ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling
      selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered. Writeable
      variants of ROM (such as EEPROM and flash memory) share properties of both
      ROM and RAM, enabling data to persist without power and to be updated
      without requiring special equipment. These persistent forms of
      semiconductor ROM include USB flash drives, memory cards for cameras and
      portable devices, and solid-state drives. ECC memory (which can be either
      SRAM or DRAM) includes special circuitry to detect and/or correct random
      faults (memory errors) in the stored data, using parity bits or error
      correction codes. In general, the term RAM refers solely to solid-state
      memory devices (either DRAM or SRAM), and more specifically the main
      memory in most computers. In optical storage, the term DVD-RAM is somewhat
      of a misnomer since, unlike CD-RW or DVD-RW it does not need to be erased
      before reuse. Nevertheless, a DVD-RAM behaves much like a hard disc drive
      if somewhat slower.

    <h2>Addressing</h2>
    <p>
      To be useful, memory cells must be readable and writeable. Within the RAM
      device, multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry is used to select memory
      cells. Typically, a RAM device has a set of address lines A0... An, and
      for each combination of bits that may be applied to these lines, a set of
      memory cells are activated. Due to this addressing, RAM devices virtually
      always have a memory capacity that is a power of two. Usually several
      memory cells share the same address. For example, a 4 bit 'wide' RAM chip
      has 4 memory cells for each address. Often the width of the memory and
      that of the microprocessor are different, for a 32 bit microprocessor,
      eight 4 bit RAM chips would be needed. Often more addresses are needed
      than can be provided by a device. In that case, external multiplexors to
      the device are used to activate the correct device that is being accessed.
    </p>
    <h2>Memory hierarchy</h2>
    <p>
      One can read and over-write data in RAM. Many computer systems have a
      memory hierarchy consisting of processor registers, on-die SRAM caches,
      external caches, DRAM, paging systems and virtual memory or swap space on
      a hard drive. This entire pool of memory may be referred to as "RAM" by
      many developers, even though the various subsystems can have very
      different access times, violating the original concept behind the random
      access term in RAM. Even within a hierarchy level such as DRAM, the
      specific row, column, bank, rank, channel, or interleave organization of
      the components make the access time variable, although not to the extent
      that access time to rotating storage media or a tape is variable. The
      overall goal of using a memory hierarchy is to obtain the highest possible
      average access performance while minimizing the total cost of the entire
      memory system (generally, the memory hierarchy follows the access time
      with the fast CPU registers at the top and the slow hard drive at the
      bottom). In many modern personal computers, the RAM comes in an easily
      upgraded form of modules called memory modules or DRAM modules about the
      size of a few sticks of chewing gum. These can quickly be replaced should
      they become damaged or when changing needs demand more storage capacity.
      As suggested above, smaller amounts of RAM (mostly SRAM) are also
      integrated in the CPU and other ICs on the motherboard, as well as in
      hard-drives, CD-ROMs, and several other parts of the computer system.
